            <h1>Can you prove it?</h1>
            <p>In 1980, Lee Strobel was an atheist journalist and investigative reporter for the Chicago Tribune. After his wife's conversion to Christianity, he spent two years attempting to disprove the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The results of his research as well as events in his own life ultimately led him to become a Christian himself.</p>
            
            <h2>The Gospels are truth</h2>
            <p>The four gospel books of the Bible, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were written by eyewitnesses as biographies of Jesus' life. They were all written approximately between 20 and 70 years after the resurrection of Jesus. These records are accurate because they were written carefully by eyewitnesses.</p>
            <p><i>Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.</i><br><b>Luke 1:1-2 NIV</b></p>

            <h3>And it's not just the New Testament</h3>
            <p>Experts agree that, whether the resurrection is true or not, Jesus was indeed a real person who lived sometime between 3 A.D. and 33 A.D. Sources outside the New Testament back this up. For example, in 93 A.D., Jewish historian Josephus published "Antiquities of the Jews", a document that records the influence of Jesus.</p>
            <p><i>Now there was about this time, Jesus, a wise man for he was a doer of wonderful works. A teacher of such men as received the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the hews and many of the gentiles.</i></p>

            <h2>Jesus is who he says he is</h2>
            <p>Jesus claimed that he was the one to fulfill the prophecy of the Old Testament, essentially portraying himself as the son of God. In Jesus's time, both the followers and opposers attested that Jesus did perform miracles. The New Testament records 40 different miracles. Throughout the New Testament, Jesus demonstrates the power and authority of God.</p>
            <p>The Old Testament references Jesus hundreds of years before his life, including specific details like where he would be born, specific actions he would take, and his ultimate death and resurrection. One specific example is in Psalm 22, written by David, where he writes in first person, "they have pierced my hands and my feet." In this passage, David describes crucifixion hundreds of years before its existence.</p>
            <p>There is also proof that the tomb of Jesus was empty three days after his death. The Jewish authorities claimed that the disciples stole the body of Jesus from the tomb. Both parties agreed that the tomb was indeed empty on the third day. If not so, the opposers would certainly have publicly displayed the body when the church began proclaiming the resurrection.</p>
            <p>In Paul's letter to the church in Corinth, Paul writes that Jesus appeared to more than 500 people (including himself) after his resurrection. At the time after this letter, many of these people would still be alive and Paul implies to the church that there are live eyewitnesses of Jesus after his death.</p>
            <p>Following the resurrection, the disciples of Jesus spread the word throughout the region and the rest of the known world. They were heavily persecuted and faced great difficulties to spread the gospel, which would be unrealistic if the story they were spreading was known to be false.</p>
            <p><i>I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.</i><br><b>2 Corinthians 11:23 NIV</b></p>

            <hr>

            <p>It seems more unrealistic to me for the gospel to be false than for it to be true.</p>

            <h1>So what does this all mean?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Scripture is Inspired.</b> The Scriptures both Old and New Testament
                    are the inspired, inerrant revelation of God to man and the authority of faith
                    and conduct.</li>
                <li><b>The One True God.</b> The one true God has revealed Himself as the “I AM,”
                    the Creator, and Redeemer of mankind.</li>
                <li><b>The Deity of Jesus.</b> The Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God. The
                    Scriptures declare His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, death and
                    resurrection, and ascension to the right hand of God.</li>
                <li><b>The Salvation of Man.</b> Man’s only hope is through the shed blood of
                    Jesus Christ. Salvation is by faith through grace and demonstrated in
                    repentance.</li>
                <li><b>Sanctification.</b> The act of separation from that which is evil, and
                    dedication unto God.</li>
                <li><b>The Church and its Mission.</b> The church is the representative of Jesus
                    on earth and is to carry out the Great Commission.</li>
                <li><b>The Ministry.</b> A divinely called and scripturally ordained minister has been
                    provided by God to lead the church in evangelization, worship, building the
                    body, and general leadership of the church.</li>
                <li><b>Divine Healing. </b>Is provided for today by the Scriptures and included in the
                    atonement for our sins.</li>
                <li><b>The Blessed Hope. </b> The resurrection of the just is the blessed hope of the
                    body of Christ.</li>
                <li><b>The Millennial Reign.</b> The second coming of Christ includes the rapture
                    and a return to earth by Christ with His saints for a thousand-year reign.</li>
                <li><b>The Final Judgement.</b> There will be a final judgement at which all men will
                    be judged.</li>
                <li><b>The New Heaven and Earth.</b> All of God’s children will reign forever in a
                    new heaven and a new earth.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you want to learn more, find a local Bible-believing church and attend a service. Ask questions with the intent to understand. Get a Bible or find an online version and read the New Testament. The gospel is good news. (That is the literal translation.) The good news is that you don't have to be perfect. All you have to do is say yes to salvation in Jesus Christ.</p>
